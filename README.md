NFT as warrenty card

##The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.

->Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.

->For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows
  customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
  
 ->Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of
   their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
   
->The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track
   repairs and replacements to the original item.
   
->Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.

->Deploy it on polygon blockchain.
